        <p>Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 70 mph (112 km/h). A cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 45 mph in just two and a half seconds. Cheetahs have semi-retractable claws that act like the studs or cleats of running shoes, giving them traction during high-speed chases </p>
